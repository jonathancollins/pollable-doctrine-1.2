Pollable provides Doctrine 1.2 models with polling and data collection capabilities. It handles responses and assists you in analyzing the results. It is useful in collecting and reporting user opinions or ratings in content-oriented, community-driven websites--rating an article from one to five stars, giving a video a thumbs up or down, or marking a comment funny or insightful, for example--but is also useful in general data collection and analyzation.



The extension is bundled with a diverse set of out-of-the-box response handlers. If they do not fit your exact needs, the internal storage API can be extended to store and analyze exactly the type of responses you're looking to collect.
