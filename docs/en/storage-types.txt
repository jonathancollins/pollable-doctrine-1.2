++ Discrete

Discrete storage is the base behavior for many other storage types, but it can be used on its own. Discrete polls are defined as follows:

    [yml]
    DiscretePoll:
      storage:
        type: discrete
        options:
          values: [a,b,c]
    
The `values` option is required and tells the discrete storage which responses to accept:

    [php]
    $ent->DiscretePoll->respond('a');
    $ent->DiscretePoll->respond('b');
    $ent->DiscretePoll->respond('c');
    
    $ent->DiscretePoll->respond('d'); //throws Doctrine_Pollable_Exception
